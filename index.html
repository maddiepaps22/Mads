<h2>Project 1: Digital Design</h2>
<p>2D Design Proposal
For my 2D logo design for the Southworth Planetarium, I want to go with a circular design to
represent planets. I want it to act as a symbol to make people want to go to the planetarium.
Focusing the design on the interaction the space has with children and families. I chose to use
colors of blues, purples, black tones, and white tones to illuminate a galaxy theme. The small
person on the logo is meant to represent a child. The circles with fading colors is representation
of ga alaxy. The greyish blue moon is to show more of a connection to space. I was inspired by
regular street sign logos with the bubbled stick figures as a representation of what to do, for
example, the caution wet floor figure, whose acting out is falling on the sign. Or at the entrances or
bathrooms. I decided to use one and make it small to represent a child.<p>

<h2>Project 2: Photoshop Art</h2>
<p>Project statement: For the photo manipulation project, where we needed to show a dystopian and utopian version of a world, 
  I chose to make a very drastic change between my utopian and dystopian worlds. 
  For my Utopia, I chose to take a snowglobe and change the color of the stand to purple because it's one of my favorite colors. 
  I took an image of a beautiful snowy background and enhanced the colors to the point of clipping, giving the viewer the sense that the world is fake, which is how most utopian societies feel in movies. 
  I put in the lodge of my ski mountain, where I grew up. This gives my utopian world personal meaning. I also stuck with bright colors to make it more vibrant and happy. 
  I also added a skier at the front walking down the road inside the snow globe, representing thatthe  snow globe scenes are perfect, and going skiing is a part of my utopia. 
  For my dystopia, I chose to create a horror scene with a face emerging from the boardwalk, where I altered the colors to be red, fading to black. 
  The face has blue eyes, representative of my own eye color. I took the eyes and placed them all around to make the viewer feel uncomfortable.
  I choose to put the face in the horizon line to act as a portal into the dystopian society that lies within the mouth of the monster. 
  I made the scene dark like a horror movie because I'm not a fan of horror, so this is a great representation of what dystopia is to me.<p>

<h2>Project 3: Video Project </h2>
<p>For my Video assignment, Ashing Out, I chose to pick clips that have to do with cigarettes and smoking. 
     I have fallen victim to nicotine. I may not smoke cigarettes, but I vape, and I chose to make my video based on that as a motivator to quit. 
     I hope viewers see my video as funny, informative, and entertaining. As we grow up, we are shown all these psa videos on why we shouldn't do certain things.
     None of them ever stuck with me because they aren't entertaining, so I'd doze off. So I made my version of a psa video that I hope is engaging enough for the audience to want to watch over and over again.
     All clips were used for the Prelinger site, and I used 4 different videos to compose my work, using thought out clip placement and sounds. 
     I enjoy the old-fashioned feel my video has because it reminds me of the psa videos I'd watch in school during the D.A.R.E. program.</p>

<h2>Project 4: 3D Blender Project</h2>
<p> For my blender project, I was going to at first make a fork, then realized that 3D modeling is much harder than I predicted. So instead I went back to the drawing board and thought about making a mug. I chose to make a purple mug because I do love the color purple, and as a ceramic major, I incorporate purple in a lot of my glazing so I thought making the mug purple would be fitting. As I mentioned, being a ceramic major also inspired me to make a mug because this past fall semester, I made a lot of mugs. I liked the idea of combining what I do in the pottery studio on a digital platform. I would honestly rather throw a mug than make one in a 3D digital space, but that's a personal preference.</p>
