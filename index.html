<h2>Project 1: Digital Design</h2>
<p>2D Design Proposal
For my 2D logo design for the Southworth Planetarium, I want to go with a circular design to
represent planets. I want it to act as a symbol to make people want to go to the planetarium.
Focusing the design on the interaction the space has with children and families. I chose to use
colors of blues, purples, black tones, and white tones to illuminate a galaxy theme. The small
person on the logo is meant to represent a child. The circles with fading colors is representation
of ga alaxy. The greyish blue moon is to show more of a connection to space. I was inspired by
regular street sign logos with the bubbled stick figures as a representation of what to do, for
example, the caution wet floor figure, whose acting out is falling on the sign. Or at the entrances or
bathrooms. I decided to use one and make it small to represent a child. .</p>
