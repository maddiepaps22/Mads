<h2>Project 1: Digital Design</h2>
<p>2D Design Proposal
For my 2D logo design for the Southworth Planetarium, I want to go with a circular design to
represent planets. I want it to act as a symbol to make people want to go to the planetarium.
Focusing the design on the interaction the space has with children and families. I chose to use
colors of blues, purples, black tones, and white tones to illuminate a galaxy theme. The small
person on the logo is meant to represent a child. The circles with fading colors is representation
of ga alaxy. The greyish blue moon is to show more of a connection to space. I was inspired by
regular street sign logos with the bubbled stick figures as a representation of what to do, for
example, the caution wet floor figure, whose acting out is falling on the sign. Or at the entrances or
bathrooms. I decided to use one and make it small to represent a child. <p>

<h2>Project 2: Photoshop Art</h2>
<p>Project statement For the photo manipulation project, where we needed to show a dystopian and utopian version of a world, 
  I chose to make a very drastic change between my utopian and dystopian world. 
  For my Utopia, I chose to take a snowglobe and change the color of the stand to purple because it's one of my favorite colors. 
  I took an image of a beautiful snowy background and enhanced the colors to the point of clipping, giving the viewer the sense that the world is fake, which is how most utopian societies feel in movies. 
  I put in the lodge of my ski mountain, where I grew up. This gives my utopian world personal meaning. I also stuck with bright colors to make it more vibrant and happy. 
  I also added a skier at the front walking down the road inside the snow globe, representing that snow globe scenes are perfect, and going skiing is a part of my utopia. 
  For my dystopia, I chose to make a horror scene with a face coming down the boardwalk that I changed the colors on to be red faded to black. 
  The face has blue eyes, representative of my own eye color. I took the eyes and placed them all around to make the viewer feel uncomfortable.
  I choose to put the face in the horizon line to act as a portal into the dystopian society that lies within the mouth of the monster. 
  I made the scene dark like a horror movie because I'm not a fan of horror so this is a great representation of what dystopia is to me.<p>
